## Installation

You can add Calypso to your server with [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=416451977380364288&scope=bot&permissions=268528727) link! Alternatively, you can clone this repo and host the bot yourself.
```
git clone https://github.com/sabattle/CalypsoBot.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.

## Set Up

You have to create a ``config.json`` file in order to run the bot (you can use the example file provided as a base). Your file should look something like this:
```
{
  "token": "your_token_here",
  "ownerId": "your_ID_here",
  "apiKeys": {
    "catApi": "your_API_key_here",
    "googleApi": "your_API_key_here"
}
```
Visit the Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app and use the client token you are given for the ``token`` option. ``ownerId`` is your own Discord snowflake. To get keys for supported APIs, vist:

  * [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)
  * [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)

Once done, feel free to launch Calypso using the command ``node app.js`` or ``nodemon app.js``. If on Linux, you can also kick off using the ``start.sh`` script. If you need additional help setting up, join the [Calypso Support Server](https://discord.gg/pnYVdut)!

### Colors

To have colors on your server, first create a bunch of empty roles at the bottom of your server's role heirarchy. The names of these roles must begin with the character ``#``, for example, ``#Red`` or ``#Blue``. Then change the color of that role to your desired hex, and that's it!  Or, use the provided ``createcolor`` command to quickly and easily create new colors. After they are set up, the members of your server can then change their color by using Calypso's color commands!
